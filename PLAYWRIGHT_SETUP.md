## Railway Deployment

The `railway.json` is configured with all necessary dependencies:
- Chromium browser and driver
- All required system libraries
- Automatic Playwright setup on build

## Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Setup Playwright
python setup_playwright.py

# Run with Playwright enabled
ENABLE_PLAYWRIGHT=true uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## Testing

```bash
# Check if Playwright is enabled
curl http://localhost:8000/api/stats

# Test scraping
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/hotels/scrape-prices \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "hotel_name": "Hilton Makkah",
    "city": "Makkah",
    "checkin_date": "2024-03-01", 
    "checkout_date": "2024-03-05"
  }'
```

## Error Handling

- Automatic fallback to simulated prices if scraping fails
- All errors tracked in Sentry with context
- Performance monitoring for scraping operations
- Graceful degradation if Playwright initialization fails

## Performance Considerations

- Browser instance is shared across requests (singleton pattern)
- Concurrent scraping from multiple platforms
- 30-second timeout for page loads
- Headless mode for better performance

## Security

- User-Agent rotation to avoid detection
- No personal data is scraped
- Only public pricing information is collected
- All scraped URLs are tracked for compliance
